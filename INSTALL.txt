Thanks for downloading django-nano.

It is too fresh to have a setup.py yet, so place the included ``nano``
directory in your python-path somehow, for instance by copying or
symlinking. This is especially useful if you're working from a
subversion checkout.

These tools and applications require Python 2.4 or later, and Django
1.0 or later. You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and
Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
